# Svelte 5 testing example

I created this project with two objectives, learn **svelte 5** and improve my **testing** skills on javascript environments using Vitest.

## Overview

The application connects to the OpenWeather API and fetches weather data on the server side, managing all API logic securely on the backend. The client side is focused solely on displaying this information, providing users with current weather conditions, forecasts, and other relevant data in an intuitive and responsive interface.
